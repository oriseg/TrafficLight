        //public MainPageVM() { trafficLight.LightChanged += OnLightChanged; }

        //2. In TrafficLight.cs, we got this line, for example:
        //LightChanged?.Invoke(this, new LightChangedEventArgs(tl));
        //The LightChanged relates to the event, and the invoke just tells it to run all the methods that are in the events list, with those parametes.
